## Voice Command POS System (Prototype)

This is a FastAPI-based prototype for a Point of Sale (POS) system that allows merchants to manage sales, billing, and inventory using simple Urdu voice commands.
It uses UpliftAI's Speech-to-Text (STT) API to transcribe spoken commands into text and trigger dummy responses.
